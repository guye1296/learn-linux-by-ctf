# history

It is important to use the terminal efficiently. Always look for the shortest way to get things done.

A *very* important feature in the shell is the _history file_. The _history file_, named `.bash_history`, contains all the commans that were executed.

Pressing up in your terminal will display commands you types, starting from the most recent command and going back through the command history.

The `history` command displays the content of the history file as well.


In addition, you can *search* the history file for a command by pressing _ctrl+r_: the character sequence you type afterwards will be searched in the command history. This is called *reverse search*. Using reverse search efficiently saves a large amount of time.
